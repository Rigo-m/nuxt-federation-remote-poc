# nuxt-federation-poc

Install dependencies in both packages (this is not a monorepo, rather a collection of packages)

Build and serve the nuxt package, start the webpack package afterwards

This is a rough implementation, some stuff like the unctx stuff is shamelessly plugged in from the nuxt/storybook module, maybe it isn't needed
